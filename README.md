## 11ty w/ Pug

This is an 11ty starter with Pug templating instead of default nunchucks template.

To get started fork/copy/download and in gitlab page setup the DNS: since the pages are using absolute reference. The gitlab-ci.yml will auto-deploy via a node build script.

- You can edit using gitLab's web IDE (and it will auto deploy check ) - this makes you as productive as low-code! Here is how to render white spaces: http://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343808 
- I use gitlab as I find it easier to work with on my linux cloud than github.
- It has a nice class-less css http://gitlab.com/cekvenich2/fe/-/blob/main/src/globalAssets/stylize.css inspired by *vasanthv* ( http://vasanthv.com/stylize.css/demo.html . You can extend via http://codepen.io/flpwgr/pen/qbMJaY ).
- I'd recommend you use index.pug as name, what that means is that you use folders for 'path' names.
