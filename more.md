A web app is a supper set of a web site. So as Front End devloper (FE) to know how to do a website - here we use 11ty w/ pug templating lang. A good way to find good Sr. FE developers is to look for PHP people, they tend to be bette at FE than .js people. ( .js people can be leveraged for full stack stuff and devops, such as 'npm nbake').

- /pg2 has client side logging, that you have to edit logger.js - and have a logger service running, for example the one installed with 'npx nbake -b'.
- you should setup your domain(I recommend porkbun.com) to point CDN (I recommend bunny.net) to gilab pages, in public. If you have a low traffic site, you don't need a CDN, you can just use gitlab pages with your domain.


- you should add analytics, like http://goatcounter.com (can be self hosted)
- you should setup and maintain SEO at http://search.google.com/search-console/about

- I recomend agilecrm.com CRM.

- A good first step is wire frame, then find some example sites to mimic their UX.

- It has init.js of some nice dependencies that can be loaded, including userbase.js
